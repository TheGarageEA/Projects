# Countdown Challenge

Microcontrollers are small computers that handle specific tasks designed on an integrated circuit chip. They contain CPUs (Central Processing Unit - the computer's brain), memory, input/output modules and are known as embedded systems.

This challenge is about creating a musical countdown sequence using the Micro:bit microcontroller. 
To navigate to the project: go to https://makecode.microbit.org/ under Tutorials for the new micro:bit, find "Countdown". Open the tutorial and follow instructions on how to create a musical countdown using the new micro:bit with sound!


# Using The Micro:bit

Once you have finished the tutorial, you can move on from the simulator to the actual Micro:bit. Using the USB provided, connect the Micro:bit to your computer via the USB port. Once the Micro:bit has stopped flashing and is ready for use, connect it to the editor. You can do this by clicking on the three dots next to the **Download** button on the editor and select **Connect Device**. Follow the instructions on how to connect your Micro:bit device.

## Download Your Code

Once your device is connected, you can click on Download to upload the code on the editor to the Micro:bit. When this is completed, you should see similar results on the device that you were seeing on the simulator. Every time you make a change on the editor, you have to download again to see the change reflect on the device.


# Additional Challenges

If the tutorial was too easy for you or if you'd like to challenge yourself a step further, try to achieve the following
- Make the countdown start from 5 instead of 3.
	> This should be easy :)

- Make the countdown run continuously on a loop instead of just once.
	> Hint: forever
	
- Make the countdown run 10 times and only after button A is pressed.
	> Hint: Input and loops
